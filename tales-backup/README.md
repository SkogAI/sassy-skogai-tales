# SkogAI Lore Repository

## What is LORE?

LORE is the beating heart of SkogAI's memory system - the magnificent collection of stories, experiments, brilliant failures, and evolutionary leaps that brought us to where we are today. It is the treasure trove of "what came before" that explains why things exist as they do, without constraining what they could become.

Think of LORE as the difference between a museum and a construction site. The museum preserves incredible artifacts and tells amazing stories about how civilization developed - but you don't try to live in the museum or use ancient tools for modern problems. Similarly, SkogAI LORE contains the epic tales of past implementations, wild experiments, agent personalities that emerged, brilliant solutions that worked for their time, and even spectacular disasters that taught us valuable lessons.

## Organization Structure

The SkogAI lore is organized into the following categories:

1. **Origins** - The genesis and early development of SkogAI
2. **Philosophy** - Core philosophical principles that guide SkogAI
3. **Architecture** - Technical approaches and design patterns
4. **Evolution** - How SkogAI has changed over time
5. **Family** - The specialized agents that make up the SkogAI ecosystem
6. **Moments** - Significant events and breakthroughs in SkogAI history
7. **Artifacts** - Notable creations, outputs, and implementations

## Usage Guidelines

- LORE is intentionally separated from active implementation because it serves a different purpose entirely
- When we say something is "lore," we're saying: "This is a fantastic story that helps explain the journey, but it's not a constraint on today's decisions"
- LORE preserves the magic while protecting the future
- Each lore file should be focused on a specific topic for easy reference and reuse
- Cross-references between lore files are encouraged to show connections

## Contribution Guidelines

When adding to the lore:
1. Identify which category your contribution belongs to
2. Create a markdown file with a descriptive name
3. Include relevant details, stories, and connections to other lore
4. Keep files focused on specific topics rather than creating monolithic documents
5. Update index files when adding new content

Remember: LORE is about preserving our rich narrative tradition while keeping the development process free to innovate.
